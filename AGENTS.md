# Hex repo family

`hex-dev` is the development monorepo where new Hex sublibraries are
incubated before they are split out for release. `hex` is the released
aggregate repo; it depends on one shared semantic version of the released
split libraries.

The authoritative list of split repos published from `hex-dev` is
[`scripts/release/released.yml`](scripts/release/released.yml), which
lists them in topological (upstream-first) order along with each repo's
library name, SPEC, fixtures, oracles and cross-repo pins. Read that
file rather than a list restated elsewhere: the set grows as new
sublibraries are released, and prose copies go stale.

Two structural things the manifest encodes:

- `hex-test-kit` is the shared conformance/bench helper library
  (source: `Hex/`), not user-facing Hex API.
- `leanprover/hex` is `pins_only`: it publishes no library source and is
  re-pinned to the shared version synced each run, so it is listed last. Its README
  is generated from `scripts/release/hex-README.md` plus the manifest's
  `component:` labels (see [SPEC/readme.md](SPEC/readme.md)).

Computational libraries are Mathlib-free; `*-mathlib` repos are the
Mathlib bridge layers and should contain correspondence proofs and
Mathlib-facing APIs.

## Source-of-truth model: develop here, publish outward

`hex-dev` is the **single source of truth** for every library. All
development happens in this one tree; a single `lake build` (plus the
`bench/` and `conformance/` sub-projects) builds everything together.
The split repos are **published mirrors**: a dispatchable CI
workflow regenerates each one from the matching content in `hex-dev`,
rewriting their cross-repo Lake requirements, committing to their `main`, and
tagging every mirror with the same release version.
Never hand-edit a released repo; change it here and let the sync publish.

Every library uses the same per-library layout (so the publish step is a
near-mechanical copy):

- `HexX/` — library source plus the `HexX.lean` umbrella.
- `HexX/SPEC/hex-x.md` — the library's SPEC.
- `bench/HexX/Bench.lean` — bench drivers (shared `bench/` sub-project).
- `conformance/HexX/{Conformance,EmitFixtures}.lean` — conformance
  drivers (shared `conformance/` sub-project).
- `conformance-fixtures/HexX/*.jsonl`, `scripts/oracle/<lib>_*.py`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — selected from the complete per-repository
  workflows in `scripts/release/released-ci.yml`.

The publish mechanism is `scripts/release/released.yml` (the per-repo
managed-path + pin manifest), `scripts/release/released-ci.yml` (the managed
mirror CI workflows), `scripts/release/sync_released.py` (the
driver; supports `--dry-run`), `scripts/release/synced.json` (the
per-repo `main` baseline and shared release version), and
`.github/workflows/sync-released.yml` (manual dispatch, dry by default).
A real sync overwrites each released repo's managed paths, rewrites its Hex
requirements to the next shared minor version, and tags the resulting commit,
so it must only run once this monorepo is at or ahead of
every released repo's `main`. Run `--dry-run` first.

**Uncoordinated-commit guard.** The sync refuses to overwrite a released
repo whose `main` HEAD has moved off the recorded baseline, so an
out-of-band commit on a released repo is never silently clobbered; it
skips that repo and reports the divergence (override with `--force` only
after reconciling). Reconciling means **re-seeding**: bring the affected
library's content here up to the released `main`, rebuild the whole graph
green (a released repo can advance with breaking API changes its
downstream consumers have not adopted — the monorepo build surfaces
that), then re-run the sync.

The baseline lives on a dedicated, unprotected `release-sync-baseline`
branch that the workflow reads and advances on every real run, so a single
`workflow_dispatch` (dry-run first, then `dry_run=false`) drives the whole
publish through with no follow-up. A partial failure leaves a pending release
bound to its source commit, and the retry completes that version rather than
incrementing again. `scripts/release/synced.json` is the
bootstrap seed used only before that branch exists.

# hex — agent-specific conventions

Conventions specifically for LLM agents working on this project.
General project doctrine (Mathlib-free split, SPEC/PLAN structure,
key files) lives in `SPEC/` and `PLAN.md`; start there for
orientation.

## Style

Don't add "research completed" timestamps, progress notes, or
meta-commentary about the history of our research process to any
file. The git history tracks that. SPEC files and `PLAN/` contain
the current state of the design, not a journal of how we got there.

## Mathematical terminology

Use only standard terminology an expert in Berlekamp–Zassenhaus and LLL
recognizes immediately — no coined jargon or private coordinate names —
and let proofs track the operations the executable performs rather than a
parallel reformulation of them.

## Lean

Check diagnostics after every step; don't continue past errors. Build
via `lake build`, not `lean` directly. `native_decide` is banned (see
SPEC).

Never introduce an `axiom`. This includes converting an existing
`theorem`/`def`/`example` into an `axiom` when a refactor breaks its
proof — fix the proof or fix the API. For unfinished proofs use
`sorry`, which is grep-able and produces a warning; `axiom` is silent.

## Directives are hypotheses, not specs

A directive is an issue that requests a SPEC- or PLAN-mandated outcome;
it does not require a particular GitHub label.

When you work on a directive issue, the body is the author's *current
best understanding* of what the work looks like. It is not gospel.
Before opening a PR, sanity-check the premise:

- Does the type signature the directive asks for actually admit a
  proof, or is it unsoundly typed (allows non-canonical witnesses,
  missing hypotheses, vacuous quantifiers)?
- Does the existing infrastructure the directive points at actually
  support the claimed composition, or is a key bridge missing?
- Is the decomposition the directive proposes the right one, or
  would a different split close the obligation in fewer pieces?

If the premise is sound: execute. If the premise is wrong: **stop,
comment on the issue explaining what's wrong with concrete
evidence (counterexample, missing-lemma shape, infrastructure
gap), and leave the issue open for an updated directive.**
Do *not* file a sub-decomposition issue as a workaround; that
escalates the problem rather than fixing it. Do *not* invent
sorries or axioms to bash through. Do *not* silently weaken the
theorem to make a proof go through; that hides the premise problem
from the next reviewer.

A worker who correctly diagnoses an unsound directive saves more
project time than one who lands a partial PR against it.

The author of a directive (often me or another agent) cannot see
every interaction with existing types and lemmas at directive-
authoring time. Reading the source, finding the contradiction, and
posting it back is the highest-leverage thing you can do when the
directive doesn't match reality.

## Naming: short verb-noun forms

Type / def / theorem names with more than ~3 qualifiers are a
smell. If you find yourself writing five or more qualifying words,
stop and rethink:

- Often the qualifiers belong in a namespace, not the name.
- Often the name is restating *use-site context* ("Initial",
  "Regular", "Step") rather than naming the *thing*. Find the
  noun.
- The Mathlib aesthetic to imitate: short verb-noun forms,
  qualifiers in namespaces. `Matrix.det`, not
  `MatrixLeibnizExpandedFiniteDeterminantValue`.

When you encounter an existing AI-slop name with 5+ qualifiers
(the pattern from a model adding defensive disambiguation), rename
it. Long names are tech debt; the next agent has to keep them
exactly as long. Renaming is cheap; preserving slop is expensive.

Concrete heuristic: if a name's qualifier list reads like a
sentence describing what it's used for, that sentence belongs in
the docstring, and the name should be the noun.

## CI: extend, don't fan out

Before touching anything under `.github/workflows/`, read
[SPEC/CI.md](../SPEC/CI.md). Each workflow runs in **exactly one
ubuntu job** (`ci.yml` also has one macOS job for the dyld
cross-check). New conformance targets, new oracles, and new bench
targets **extend the script** of the existing single job — they do
not introduce new top-level jobs, `strategy.matrix` blocks, or new
workflow files. New oracles append a tuple to
`scripts/ci/run_oracles.sh` and (if needed) an entry to the existing
apt/pip install step; see
[SPEC/testing.md § Adding a new oracle](../SPEC/testing.md).

Bench targets in particular must not import Mathlib (directly or
transitively) and must keep the `Bench verify` step under its
wallclock cap; see
[SPEC/benchmarking.md §Mathlib-free benches](../SPEC/benchmarking.md)
and the "Time budget" subsection of
[SPEC/benchmarking.md §CI integration](../SPEC/benchmarking.md).

## Performance measurements use the shared host

There is no dedicated performance machine. Treat host activity as recorded
context, never as a reason to discard a completed sample or wait for a quiet
core. Pin a measurement to one automatically selected CPU when the runner
supports it, to avoid two Hex measurements choosing the same CPU; the selected
CPU need not be idle. Ordinary complexity evidence uses lean-bench's fixed,
trial-major schedule. Before/after comparisons run adjacent arms and alternate
`AB`/`BA` order. Retain every completed run and allow at most one unchanged
rerun after an inconclusive result. Do not add quiet-core preflights,
contamination thresholds, retry-until-clean loops, mandatory null controls, or
per-change profiles. Profile only to explain an unexpected result or to supply
one required representative Phase-4 attribution. Absolute wall-clock values
are host-specific observations; CI timeouts are operational safeguards, not
scientific budgets.

GitHub-hosted Actions on a personal account is concurrency-capped at
~20 parallel ubuntu runners across all repositories the account
owns; a 10-entry matrix saturates the cap, a 40-entry matrix
produces 24-hour queue waits. Per-target parallelism does not
amortise the fixed Mathlib cache fetch and startup cost on this
project, so the rule is "no parallelism in CI." Routine timing-
sensitive runs are collected manually on the shared host (per
[SPEC/benchmarking.md](../SPEC/benchmarking.md)), not on the
merge-gating workflows.

## Work assignment

Work is assigned by hand through GitHub issues, one issue per SPEC.
Use the assigned issue and its linked SPEC to determine the scope.
Use `PLAN.md` and `PLAN/` as phase reference material; the assignment
workflow here governs issue selection and progress reporting.

## Off-limits files

Agents must not modify `AGENTS.md` (also read through the
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` symlink) or the roadmap file `PLAN.md` unless
explicitly instructed to edit them.
